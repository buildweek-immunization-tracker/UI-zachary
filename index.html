            <h2>Why</h2>
            <p>The electronic records have been easier to track. A poor record can lead
                to having your child receive a second dose when they already got one. Paper 
                records can get misplaced and this will not be good if your child didn't 
                get a shot.

                    Your provider will make sure that your child is current
                    with their immunzation shots. This will make it
                    easier for the provides to see what your child has next.
